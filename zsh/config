# Prompt
#

## with this prompt, the prompt character changes to a little git symbol
## when inside a git repo, and the current git branch is displayed 
## on the right. it's nice, but it ads a lot of delay, as it has to invoke
## git each time. maybe there is a lower level solution out there, but
## deactivating for now.
